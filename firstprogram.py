Python is a case-sensitive language that means Capital A is different from small a

a = 10000
b = 5000
diff= a-b
print (diff)

arithmetic operators
a = 5
a = 4
b = 2

sum = a + b
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a ** b)

Relational operator
a = 50
b = 30

print(a == b) #False
print(a != b) #True
print(a >= b) #True
print(a > b) #True
print(a <= b) #False
print(a < b) #False

Assignment operator
num = 10
num = num  * 5
num **=5 
print("num :",num)

Logical operator
a = 50
b = 30
print(not False)
print(not(a > b))

val1 = True
val2 = False
print("AND operator:", val1 and val2)

 print("OR operator:", val1 and val2)

type conversion
a = int("2") 
b = 4.25

sum = a + b 
print(sum)
